# Python-Projects
This repository is showcasing some of the projects that I have completed during my Codeacademy course.
This is my first time learning Python, it has been a very fun and interesting experience understanding how Python works and all the features that are available.

# Magic 8 Ball
This project was a small and quick project covering if and else statements and also using the random function to generate random numbers. This project was fairly easy to understand as it was a basic introduction and usage of if loops.

# Carly's Clippers
In this project I used lists, for loops, length and range functions. I used a for loop to iterate through the list and to do a calculation with the values from the list, I also used the length function to workout the average of one of the lists. Furthermore, I used string interpolation to then output that calculated value. This project was a bit more challenging as this was the first time I worked with for loops, this project also helped me understand the importance of indentations and how they can change the flow of a project.
