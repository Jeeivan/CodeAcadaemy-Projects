# Python-Projects
This repository showcases some of the projects that I have completed during my Codeacademy course.
This is my first time learning Python, and it has been a very fun and interesting experience understanding how Python works and all the features that are available.

# Magic 8 Ball
This was a small and quick project that covered if and else statements and also used the random function to generate random numbers. This project was fairly easy to understand as it was a basic introduction and usage of if loops.

Carly's Clippers
In this project, I used lists, loops, length, and range functions. I used a for loop to iterate through the list and to do a calculation with the values from the list. I also used the length function to calculate the average of one of the lists. Furthermore, I used string interpolation to then output that calculated value. This project was a bit more challenging as this was the first time I worked with for loops. This project also helped me understand the importance of indentations and how they can change the flow of a project.

# Functions
In this project, I used functions to help solve physics problems that can be useful in the real world. This project was challenging at first to get the hang of using functions, but after repeatedly using them within this project, I gained a lot of confidence in my ability to use them, understand their purpose, and see how efficient they can make my code.

# Threads
This project involved finding the total number of threads that were sold for each colour of thread.
Through this project, I was able to develop a much better understanding of strings and their many different uses. This particular project involved using strings in a variety of different ways, using various built-in methods such as append, strip, split, and format. This project was fairly easy to understand.

# Scrabble
This project involved using dictionaries to calculate the points being awarded in a game. Through this project, I was able to better understand how to go through dictionaries and access keys and values in different ways. This project was fairly easy to do as it also involved iterating through keys and values in a dictionary, which I felt more confident doing after my previous experience using loops for other projects.
